# Descriptions for Dataset applied as Supporting Information for peer review purposes only

Here we provide:
1.	The principal components (PCs) and independent components (ICs) derived from groundwater levels during 200501-201812 as well as their spatial weights in the North China Plain (NCP) via the principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA).
2.	The reconstructed GRACE-type TWS data during 200503-201812 in the NCP under case 5 of the manuscript. The area is at latitude 34.5~40.5 and longitude 113~119.5.
3.  THe Scripts of critical processes for the reconstruction, including the PCA, ICA, OK, STL, MLR, and RF methods.

File descriptions:
'01_PC.npy' saves the first eight principal components derived from groundwater levels in the North China Plain via the principal component analysis;
'01_PC_Ws.npy' saves the spatial weights of the first eight principal components derived from groundwater levels in the North China Plain via the principal component analysis;
'01_IC.npy' saves the four independent components derived from groundwater levels in the North China Plain via the independent component analysis;
'01_IC_Ws.npy' saves the spatial weights of the four independent components derived from groundwater levels in the North China Plain via the independent component analysis;
'02_NCP_reconstructed_TWS.npy' saves the reconstructed GRACE-type TWS data during 200503-201812 in the North China Plain under case 5 of the manuscript;

'03_Scripts.py' saves some relevant critical scripts for the reconstruction.

These data and script files can all be loaded via Python.
